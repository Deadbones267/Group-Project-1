## PROJECT STATEMENT:
Understanding the effectiveness and efficiency of various energy sources across different U.S. regions is crucial for optimizing energy policies and consumption patterns. Weather, climate, and regional supply and demand dynamics significantly influence energy costs and availability. This project aims to analyze energy consumption patterns, costs, and resource utilization across U.S. states and regions, with a particular focus on how weather and climate affect energy efficiency.

## OBJECTIVES:
1. **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Energy Sources**:
   - Identify the most and least cost-effective energy sources (e.g., natural gas, solar, wind, coal, nuclear) in different U.S. states or regions.
   - Compare energy costs across regions, taking into account supply, demand, and resource availability.

2. **Impact of Weather and Climate on Energy Consumption**:
   - Analyze how weather patterns (e.g., temperature, seasonal changes, extreme weather events) affect energy consumption and efficiency.
   - Determine if certain regions experience higher energy costs or consumption due to weather variability (e.g., regions with colder winters or hotter summers).

3. **Resource Utilization and Energy Policy Implications**:
   - Evaluate which regions are using renewable vs. non-renewable energy sources more efficiently and at lower costs.
   - Provide insights into how weather/climate conditions should be factored into energy policies for each state or region.

## RESEARCH QUESTIONS:
  - How do weather and climate affect energy consumption in different U.S. states?
  - Which energy sources are the most cost-effective in regions with extreme weather (e.g., cold winters, hot summers)?
  - How does regional supply and demand influence the availability and price of different energy sources?
  - What role do renewable energy sources play in reducing energy costs and increasing efficiency, particularly in regions with favorable weather conditions (e.g., sunny, windy states)?
  - How do different energy policies across states impact energy costs and consumption patterns?
